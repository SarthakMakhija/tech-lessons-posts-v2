I conduct workshops on:

- [Gamifying Refactoring](https://gamifying-refactoring.github.io/): This workshop is focussed on identifying code smells and justifying refactorings by going beyond "ilities". 

> The idea is to IDENTIFY code smells and understand or justify WHY is something really a smell. Don’t justify a smell on the grounds of understandability, readability or flexibility. __Go beyond ilities and ities !!__ Don’t state “Long method is a smell because it is not readable”, rather consider this as an opportunity to go beyond reasoning which is not measurable.

- [LSM-storage Engine](https://github.com/SarthakMakhija/go-lsm): The participants gain hands-on experience building an LSM-based storage engine to understand the core components of a Key/Value store.
