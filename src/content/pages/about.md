I'm Sarthak Makhija, Principal Architect at Caizin. I write long-form essays on refactoring, storage engines, databases, and engineering trade-offs.

Prior to joining Caizin, I was with Thoughtworks where I led a team that developed a **strongly consistent**, **distributed** **key/value storage** engine in Go.

The technical ideas of our distributed key/value storage engine included:
- [golang](https://go.dev/) as the programming language
- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) as the metadata store 
- [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) as the key/value storage engine
- [raft (/multi-raft)](https://raft.github.io/) as the consensus algorithm and 
- [two-phase commit](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/two-phase-commit.html) with serial isolation level

Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and getting feedback from the community:

- **Authoring**: I contributed to the validation of distributed system patterns in the book [Patterns of Distributed Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780138222246/) by Unmesh Joshi.
  I authored articles on [persistent memory](https://kt.academy/article/pmem-intro) for Marcin Moskala.

- **Open Source**: I contribute to [open source projects](https://github.com/SarthakMakhija) aligned with my interests, exploring innovative solutions for data management and caching.
